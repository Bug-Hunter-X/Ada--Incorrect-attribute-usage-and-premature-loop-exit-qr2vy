This repository contains an example of a common Ada coding error involving the misuse of the 'Img attribute and premature loop termination.  The `bug.ada` file demonstrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to use 'Img (Image) on an Integer type and prematurely exiting a loop before processing all elements.  This can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors. The solution showcases the correct approach, highlighting the importance of understanding attribute usage and loop control in Ada.
